<h2>Basic/Automatic</h2> 
	<description>
	<blockquote><p class="proberef"></p>
	<p class="proberef"><b>Automatic</b></p>
	<p class="proberef">The Automatic probe attempts to determine whether the device speaks SNMP or whether simply to ping the device.</p>
	<p class="proberef">InterMapper sends a SNMP GetNextRequest for the sysName, sysObjectID, and sysServices OIDs (1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.5, 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.2, and 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.7, respectively) using the specified SNMP Read-only community string. If a proper SNMP response is received, InterMapper sets the device's probe to be SNMP; otherwise, InterMapper sets the device to use a Ping/Echo probe.</p>

<h2>Basic/Map Status</h2> 
	<description>
	<blockquote><p class="proberef"></p>
	<p class="proberef"><b>Map Status</b></p>
	<p class="proberef">This probe allows InterMapper to monitor the state of a map running on another InterMapper server. InterMapper periodically queries the specified map, and the icon displays the status of the "worst" item on that sub-map. Double-clicking the icon with InterMapper Remote opens a window with the remote map and brings it to the front.</p>
	<p class="proberef">To make a device with the "Map Status" probe, create a device with the DNS Name or IP address of the InterMapper server being monitored (or "localhost" if it's a local map) when adding the device to the map. Then select Map Status for the probe type, and configure it with:</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#Map Name#p# specifies the name of the map on the remote server.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#Username#p# specifies a user name that has read-permission on the map.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#Password#p# is the password for the corresponding username.</p>

<h2>Basic/Ping\/Echo</h2> 
	<description>
	<blockquote><p class="proberef"></p>
	<p class="proberef"><b>Ping/Echo</b></p>
	<p class="proberef">The <b>Ping/Echo</b> probe sends an ICMP echo request packet to the target device to determine if it is active and responding. The parameters are:</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#Number of Data Bytes#p# specifies the number of bytes of ICMP data to send. The default setting is 20 bytes. The mimimum value permitted is 16 bytes; the maximum is 2000 bytes.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#Data Pattern#p# specifies the hexadecimal pattern that is repeated throughout the payload contents.</p>
	<p class="proberef">Tip: To send a 1500 byte IP packet to an IPv4 target, set the number of data bytes to 1472. To send the same IP packet size to an IPv6 target, set the number of data bytes to 1452.</p>
	<p class="proberef">InterMapper sends the ping packet, then waits for a response. The time it waits is determined by the device's Timeout. If no response is received after that time, InterMapper re-sends the echo request, waiting again the device's Timeout. Each device has a limit of the number of pings to send (determined by the device's limit or the map's limit). If InterMapper reaches that limit without receiving a response, InterMapper declares the device to be down.</p>
	<p class="proberef">The default setting for the number of echo requests is three, and the default timeout is three seconds. Thus it can take up to nine seconds to declare a device to be down.</p>

<h2>Basic/SNMP Traffic</h2> 
	<description>
	<blockquote><p class="proberef"></p>
	<p class="proberef"><b>SNMP Traffic</b></p>
	<p class="proberef">The SNMP Traffic probe retrieves system and traffic information from a device. This information comes from the system and interfaces groups of SNMP MIB-II. </p>
	<p class="proberef">It displays traffic (bytes/second, packets/second, errors/minute) for each of the interfaces by right-clicking on a link to open the Status Window. </p>
	<p class="proberef">This also displays sysLocation, sysContact, and sysUptime from the system group in the device's Status Window.</p>

<h2>Experimental/Flow Exporter Status</h2> 
	<description>
	<blockquote><p class="proberef"></p>
	<p class="proberef"><b>Flow Exporter Status</b></p>
	<p class="proberef">The Flow Exporter Status probe monitors a Flow Exporter and reports statistics about the Flow activity. It does this by retrieving information from the InterMapper Flows server.</p>
	<p class="proberef">The normal state of the device is UP/OKAY. There are two error conditions:</p>
	<p class="proberef"><li class="proberef"> If the device being monitored does not appear to be a Flow Exporter (that is, if it is not listed by InterMapper Flows), the status of the device will be CRITICAL.  </li></p>
	<p class="proberef"><li class="proberef"> If the InterMapper Flows server has not received any flow records during a poll interval, the status of the device will be DOWN.</li></p>

<h2>Experimental/InterMapper</h2> 
	<description>
	<blockquote><p class="proberef"></p>
	<p class="proberef"><b>InterMapper Engine Status</b></p>
	<p class="proberef">This probe monitors the status of the InterMapper polling engine. With the default setting, this probe displays the results of 500 loops through the polling engine. To measure activity at a finer-grain, decrease the value of the loops parameter. Setting the "loops" parameter to the value 1 will update the statistics on every pass through the main run loop.</p>
	<p class="proberef">The "Main Loop" frequency is the number of times that InterMapper performs the main loop each second. The theoretical maximum loop frequency is 66.667 loops per second, based on the current yield value of 15 msec. If it falls below 10 or even 5 loops per second, InterMapper may report false outages.</p>
	<p class="proberef">This probe also reports polling rate as a percentage of the maximum loops per second. This is a measure of how much additional processing occurs per loop. This percentage will never be 100%. It should, however, level out and remain steady over time.</p>
	<p class="proberef">On Unix systems, this probe reports Context Switches Per Loop (CSPL). This is another measure of the overhead of InterMapper's processing as it runs on your system. Fewer context switches per loop is better (ideal = 0), since context switches carry overhead. A server with thousands of devices and hundreds of mays may well have a CSPL greater than 2 during normal operation. (This value is not available on Windows systems, and is alway set to -1.)</p>
	<p class="proberef">InterMapper tracks the number of bytes sent out the main UDP polling socket. Bytes/Loop is the average bytes sent per loop, averaged over the last batch of N loops. Bytes Peak is the maximum number of bytes sent in a *single* polling loop.  (In the current implementation, the peak bytes is checked on every loop, but only resets to 0 when you change the # loops parameter; ie peak bytes is not the peak bytes of the last batch of N loops.)</p>

	<p class="proberef">When a trap arrives, the probe parses the trap to get the values from the trap's header as well as the first ten items in its Varbind List. It assigns all these values to variables that can be used in the probe and displayed in the Status Window.</p>
	<p class="proberef">To see how this probe works, you can configure your equipment to send traps to InterMapper, or use the net-snmp <b>snmptrap</b> command. Either way, the Status Window will show the values present in any traps that arrive.</p>
	<p class="proberef">For more information on the <b>snmptrap</b> command, read the net-snmp documentation for the #u2=http://www.net-snmp.org/tutorial/tutorial-4/commands/snmptrap.html#trap tutorial#p0# and the #u2=http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/man/snmpinform.html#snmptrap command#0p#.

	<p class="proberef"><b>DHCPv4</b></p>
	<p class="proberef">The protocol used by IP clients to obtain an IPv4 address and other parameters for using TCP/IP. Depending on your setup, this probe may only work if your computer is already using an IP address acquired using BOOTP or DHCP.</p>
	<p class="proberef">Note: On Mac OS X, this probe will only work if there are no enabled DHCP, Bootp, or PPP interfaces.</p>
	<p class="proberef">This probe sends DHCP-INFORM requests to test the DHCP mechanism for an IP subnet.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#BOOTP Relay Address#p# is the IP address to which all DHCP requests are addressed. Normal BOOTP/DHCP requests are broadcast to the local subnet (255.255.255.255), where they are picked up by the BOOTP agent in a router and relayed to the BOOTP/DHCP server. If this parameter is empty, InterMapper sends the DHCP requests directly to the target IP address specified for the device.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#DHCP Client ID#p# is an optional parameter included with InterMapper's request that can be used to identify the DHCP client as InterMapper. If you leave this parameter blank, InterMapper does not include the DHCP Client ID option in its DHCP probe.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#DHCP Subnet Mask#p# is an optional parameter specifying the expected value of the subnet mask returned by the DHCP server. If you leave this parameter blank, InterMapper will accept any subnet mask value.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#DHCP Router Address#p# is an optional parameter specifying the expected value of the router address returned by the DHCP server. If you leave this parameter blank, InterMapper will accept any router address value.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#DHCP Message Type#p# is the type of DHCP message to send. Typically, you should prefer DHCP-INFORM, since this message type will not cause an IP address to be allocated by the DHCP server. A DHCP server may respond to a DHCP-DISCOVER request by wastefully leasing out an IP address which will never be used.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#Hardware Address#p# is an optional parameter specifying the MAC address of the network interface that should be used to send the DHCP request.</p>
	<p class="proberef">#i#Request Seconds#p# is an optional parameter specifying the number of seconds to claim we have been trying for; certain DHCP servers (such as the one supplied with OS X 10.5 with the default settings) will not respond at all until the client claims to have been trying for at least 10 seconds.</p>
