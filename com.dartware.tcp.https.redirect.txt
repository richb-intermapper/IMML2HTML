²GB³Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPs) - Redirect²P³

The protocol used to transfer web pages on the World Wide Web, defined in ²U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2068.txt³RFC 2068²P0³ and  ²U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt³RFC 1945²P0³. The default TCP port number for HTTP connections is port 80.

This TCP probe lets you test that a web server is redirecting certain URL's to a specific URL.

²i³Host Name²p³ is the domain name of the web server (e.g. "www.dartware.com"). This can be derived from the host name part of the URL that you want to test. 

²i³URL Path²p³ is the full path of the desired file on the web server (e.g. "/index.html"). The first character must be a '/'.

²i³Redirect URL²p³ is the complete URL that the given URL Path is redirected to. The URL should begin with "http://".

²i³User ID²p³ is the user name typed into the web browser's password dialog. The default is to leave this blank. You should set this parameter if you want to test a web page that requires authentication.

²i³Password²p³ is the password for the web browser's dialog. The default is to leave this blank. You should set this parameter if you want to test a web page that requires authentication.
