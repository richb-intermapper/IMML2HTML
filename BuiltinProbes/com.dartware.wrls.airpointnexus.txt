\GB\smartBridges airPoint Nexus probe\P\

This probe monitors a \u2=http://www.smartbridges.com\smartBridges\p0\ airPoint Nexus device. It retrieves and displays general device information, remote device information, 
wireless statistics information and bridge information (when the device is operating as a bridge).

This probe is part of the InterMapper Wireless Probe Bundle, and requires InterMapper 4.4 or later.
