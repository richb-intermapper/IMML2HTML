	Wireless Add-on package and should not be be distributed or used without license.

	Original version 6 November 2003 - reb
	Latest revision 1 April 2005 - ics
		Some changes based on our draft Alvarion LinkBlaster probe. Devices have parallel MIBs.
	Latest revision 16-24 March 2006 - aap & rebs
		Additional thresholds added to provide for Alarm and Warning states for "Signaling Burst Rate",
      	"RF Status", and "Signal-to-Noise Ratio" (SNR).  "RF Signal Strength" was modified to utilize
      	values of "-48" for "Low Warning" and "-83" for "Too Low Alarm". 
      	Added threshold for UBR as well

\GB\Redline AN50\P\

This probe is meant to probe a \u2=http://www.redlinecommunications.com\Redline\p0\ AN50 point-to-point radio, acting as either a master or slave. It retrieves and displays a number of critical statistics for the radio, and gives alarms if it goes out of user-specified thresholds.  The probe retrieves:

\b\Average RF Rx signal strength\p\ and compares it to the Rx Signal alarm and warning thresholds specified below.

\b\Average RF SNR\p\ and compares it to the signal to noise ratio alarm and warning thresholds specified below.

\b\Signaling Burst Rate\p\ The device goes into alarm when the Uncoded Burst Rate is less than the specified code. (Codes are 0=6Mb/s,1=9Mb/s,2=12Mb/s,3=18Mb/s,4=24Mb/s,5=36Mb/s,6=48Mb/s,7=54Mbs)

\b\Operating frequency\p\ The device goes into alarm if it's different from the value specified below.

\b\Radio Link Status\p\ The device goes into alarm if it's not connected.

This probe is part of the InterMapper Wireless Add-on pack, and requires InterMapper 4.2.4 or later.
