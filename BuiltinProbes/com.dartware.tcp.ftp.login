\GB\File Transfer Protocol (Login)\P\

The standard protocol for transferring files on TCP/IP internets, as defined in \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0959.txt\RFC 959\P0\.  The default TCP port number for FTP control connections is port 21.

This TCP probe connects to the FTP server's control port (21), logs in using the specified UserID and Password, and then issues a NOOP command.  The probe concludes by issuing the QUIT command.

\i\User ID\p\ is the account name used to login to the FTP server.

\i\Password\p\ is the account password used to verify the User ID's identity.

Note:  If this probe queries the FTP server often at regular intervals, it will appear in your FTP server's log files as a succession of "Login"  and "Logout" log lines.
