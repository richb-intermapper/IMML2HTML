This probe creates an empty probe group. Once you have created a device using this probe, you can select the new probe group device and other devices and choose Insert->Group to place those devices into the single probe group. Find out more about probe groups in the User Guide at \2U\http://intermapper.com/go.php?to=intermapper.probegroups\P0\.
