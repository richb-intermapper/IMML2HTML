\GB\CVS Server\P\

This probe tests a CVS server by connecting to its port (default port is 2401) and issuing the proper authentication strings. These are:

BEGIN AUTH REQUEST<lf>
CVSROOT_Path<lf>
Username<lf>
Scrambled_password<lf>
END AUTH REQUEST<lf>

If the response is "I LOVE YOU", then the authentication succeeded.
If the response is "I HATE YOU", then either the authentication failed or the path to CVSROOT is incorrect.
