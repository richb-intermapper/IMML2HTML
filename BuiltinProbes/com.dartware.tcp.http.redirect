\GB\Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - Redirect\P\

The protocol used to transfer web pages on the World Wide Web, defined in \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2068.txt\RFC 2068\P0\ and  \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt\RFC 1945\P0\. The default TCP port number for HTTP connections is port 80.

This TCP probe lets you test that a web server is redirecting certain URL's to a specific URL.

\i\Host Name\p\ is the domain name of the web server (e.g. "www.intermapper.com"). This can be derived from the host name part of the URL that you want to test. 

\i\URL Path\p\ is the full path of the desired file on the web server (e.g. "/index.html"). The first character must be a '/'.

\i\Redirect URL\p\ is the complete URL that the given URL Path is redirected to. The URL should begin with "http://".

\i\User ID\p\ is the user name typed into the web browser's password dialog. The default is to leave this blank. You should set this parameter if you want to test a web page that requires authentication.

\i\Password\p\ is the password for the web browser's dialog. The default is to leave this blank. You should set this parameter if you want to test a web page that requires authentication.
