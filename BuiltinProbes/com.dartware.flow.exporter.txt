\GB\Flow Exporter Status\P\

The Flow Exporter Status probe monitors a Flow Exporter and reports statistics about the Flow activity. It does this by retrieving information from the InterMapper Flows server.

The normal state of the device is UP/OKAY. There are two error conditions:

* If the device being monitored does not appear to be a Flow Exporter (that is, if it is not listed by InterMapper Flows), the status of the device will be CRITICAL.  

* If the InterMapper Flows server has not received any flow records during a poll interval, the status of the device will be DOWN.
