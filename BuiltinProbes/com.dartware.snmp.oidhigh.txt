<description>
\GB\SNMP Value Too High\P\

This probe retrieves a single SNMP MIB variable and compares it to the thresholds below. If the value goes above any of these thresholds, the device severity will go into the indicated state.

\ib\Variable\p\ specifies the MIB name or OID for the value to retrieve. If you have imported the MIB for this device, you may enter the symbolic name for this value, otherwise, simply enter its OID here. 

\bi\Critical, Alarm, and Warning\p\ are the thresholds for those severities. They may be positive or negative numbers.

\bi\Legend\p\ is a text string used to identify the variable in the status window and any strip charts. If left blank, the variable's name or OID will be used.

\bi\Units\p\ is a text string that will be displayed next to the value in the Status Window. You can use it for the unit of measure (packets/sec, degrees, etc.) 

\bi\Tag\p\ is a short text string that identifies a particular class of dataset. Tags will be used to correlate different variables from different probes that describe the same thing, such as CPU% or temperature.

-- Parameters are user-settable values that the probe uses for its comparisons.
-- Specify the default values here. The customer can change them and they will be retained for each device.
