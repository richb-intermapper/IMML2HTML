\GB\Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - Proxy\P\

The protocol used to transfer web pages on the World Wide Web, defined in \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2068.txt\RFC 2068\P0\ and \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt\RFC 1945\P0\. The default TCP port number for HTTP connections is port 80.

This TCP probe lets you test that a web server can be accessed using a remote proxy server as an intermediary. For example, this probe can check if your web server is accessible from some remote location on the Internet (e.g. www.proxymate.com).

\i\URL\p\ is the full URL to the desired page on the web server,including the "http://" scheme (e.g. "http://www.intermapper.com")

\i\Proxy User ID\p\ is your user ID for the proxy server. Leave this field blank if no authentication is required to use the proxy server.

\i\Proxy Password\p\ is your password for the proxy server. Leave this field blank if no authentication is required to use the proxy server.

\i\String to verify\p\ is a string to verify in the data returned by the HTTP server.  For example, if you are retrieving a web page, you might search for "<HTML" or "<P>" to verify that the data is HTML. If this string is not found, the device will go into alarm.

\i\User Agent\p\ is the string that identifies this InterMapper client probe to the proxy web server. Some proxy servers block traffic at the proxy based on the User-Agent identity. This parameter lets you optionally override InterMapper's default User-Agent setting. If you leave this parameter blank, InterMapper sends a User-Agent  string of "InterMapper/version", where version is the current version number of InterMapper.
