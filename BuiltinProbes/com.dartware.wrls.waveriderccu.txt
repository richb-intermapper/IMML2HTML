	Original version 30 August 2004 ics,
	 10/24/2004 ics
         10/21/2005 rk  Added interface_visible directive to show the wireless interface (tested on S/W ver 6.3 build 4)

Notes (ics'):
	Wireless interface # appears to be 3
	Ethernet interface # appears to be 2
	(Loopback appears to be 1)

<!--
Had some trouble with Software Version and Serial Number.
Using a get request fixed Serial Number.
Asking for the Software Version first fixed that.

\GB\WaveRider CCU Probe\P\ - Beta

This probe monitors a WaveRider CCU (access point). It retrieves and displays a number of variables for basic, traffic, and wireless information. It will go into alarm and warning states based on user-defined parameters for radio frequency, percentage of payloads not needing a retry, percentage of payloads sent as broadcast, percentage of payloads discarded, percentage of payloads "Rx PER", percentage of payloads with HCRC errors, "Rx No-Match" errors, and high traffic incoming on the wireless interface. It will also go into an alarm based on the global status indicator.

This probe is part of the InterMapper Wireless Probe Bundle, and requires InterMapper 4.2.1 or later.
