\GB\Canopy Service Module\P\

This probe monitors a Canopy wireless service module (SM).

This probe retrieves and displays a number of variables. It will place the device in alarm or warning states based on user-defined thresholds for high re-registration count, low RSSI, high Jitter, long Round Trip delay, and low Power Level, and give an alarm if the unit is not registered.

Note that the 2x jitter thresholds will only be used when the SM is operating in 2x/2x mode.

To disable any of the thresholds, set their values to 0. 

The default poll interval for this probe is 5 minutes. The default poll interval is an automatic safeguard; polling more frequently has been shown to adversely affect the device.

This probe is part of the InterMapper Wireless Probe Bundle, and requires InterMapper 4.3 or later.
