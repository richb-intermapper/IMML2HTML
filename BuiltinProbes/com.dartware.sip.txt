\GB\Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over UDP\P\

The protocol used to set up voice communications for Voice over IP (VOIP), as described in \u2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt\RFC 3261\p0\. This probe sends a SIP request in a single UDP packet and checks for a valid SIP response.

By default, this probe sends an OPTIONS command to the target device. However, some VOIP systems will not answer un-authenticated OPTIONS requests. For these devices, change the command to REGISTER.

\i\URI\p\ is the SIP uniform resource identifier in the request.

\i\Command\p\ is the SIP command to send in the request.
