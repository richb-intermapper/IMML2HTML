  \GB\Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - Post Form Results\P\

  The protocol used to transfer web pages on the World Wide Web, defined in \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2068.txt\RFC 2068\P0\ and \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1945.txt\RFC 1945\P0\.  The default TCP port number for HTTP connections is port 80.

  This TCP probe lets you post form results to a specific web CGI.

  \i\Host Name\p\ is the domain name of the web server (e.g. "www.intermapper.com"). This can be derived from the host name part of the URL that you want to test.

  \i\URL Path\p\ is the full path to the desired CGI on the web server (e.g. "/index.cgi"). The first character must be a '/'.

  \i\Form Data\p\ is the encoded data sent in the body of the POST message.

  \i\String to verify\p\ is a string to verify in the data returned by the HTTP server.  For example, if you post form data that is designed to generate an error response, you might search for "sorry" or "could not be processed" to verify that the CGI is properly rejecting the data. If this string is not found, the device will go into alarm.
