\GB\File Transfer Protocol (No Login)\P\

The standard protocol for transferring files on TCP/IP internets, as defined in \U2=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0959.txt\RFC 959\P0\.  The default TCP port number for FTP control connections is port 21.

This TCP script connects to the FTP server's control port (21), and issues a NOOP command without logging in.  The script concludes by issuing the QUIT command.

Note:  Use this script if you are going to be frequently probing the FTP server, so it doesn't fill your log files with user logins and logouts.
